"""AWS Lambda entry points.

  • handler        — the FastAPI app behind API Gateway (HTTP API), via Mangum.
  • migrate_handler — one-off: create the schema + ensure the super_admin. Invoke
                      manually after each deploy (`aws lambda invoke ...`).

Two handlers, one deployment package — the migrate function reuses the same code
and DATABASE_URL as the API, so they can never drift apart.
